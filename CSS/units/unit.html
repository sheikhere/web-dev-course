                <p>
                    Absolute units in CSS are fixed measurements that do not change based on external factors such as the screen size, parent element, or browser settings.

                        if we give height 40% and width 50% and it's parent height is 30px and width is 15px, it will take 40% height of 30px and 50% width of 15px
